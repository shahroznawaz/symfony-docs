   single: Deployment; Deploying to Cloudways Cloud Servers

Deploying to Cloudways 
==========================================

Cloudways is a managed hosting provider for PHP based application. Almost all
frameworks and CMS are supported by Cloudways. In this deployment guide you 
will be explained step by step how to install symfony on cloudways servers. 
The article also explains how you can deploy application from git using SSH terminal
since Git and composer is already installed on Cloudways 

Step 1: Prepare your server and application
-------------------------------------------

`Signup` or `Login` to your **Cloudways account** and create a new server by selecting
PHP Stack from the **Select your Application** drop-down. Also, Name your App, 
Server & Project accordingly

Step 3: Select Server Size & Location
-------------------------------------

In **Server Size** field, scale the server as your requirement but **1GB** is the minimum recommended size.

Keeping the latency difference in mind, now select your server location in **Location** field.

To launch your server, click **Launch** button at the bottom right side of the page and wait for a while.

Step 4: Server Timezone
-----------------------

Once the server is completely launched, change your server timezone as itâ€™s the requirement to install Symfony (default value for 
timezone is not supported by Symfony). Under **Server Management**, go to **Settings & Packages.**

In **Basic** tab you can see **PHP Timezone.** Change server timezone to your respective location.

Step 5: SSH Terminal
--------------------

After changing server timezone, in **Server Management** click on **Launch SSH Terminal** under 
**Master Credentials** where you can find your login credentials for SSH Terminal.

Login to SSH with your Master Credentials.

since the application folder contains index.php by default remove it from your **public_html** directory 
using rm -Rf * command.

Step 6: Symfony Installation
----------------------------

Now in your **public_html** directory, run the following command to install Symfony 3 on your server:

`composer create-project symfony/framework-standard-edition your_project_name "3.1.*"`

This command will create a symfony project in public_html. You can also install any version of the symfony
just by replacing version number.

Step 7: DB Information and Finishing Project Installation
---------------------------------------------------------

Now Symfony will start downloading to your server. During downloading, it will ask for your database information.

You can find out your DB information under **Application Management** go to **Access detail** and see MySQL Access.

After providing database information, in very few seconds you will see the following screen which means that 
Symfony has been installed successfully.

Step 7: Running in Browser
--------------------------

After a successful installation, in **Application Management** go to **Access detail** and copy your Application URL.

Open your favorite web browser and access to Welcome page to Symfony by the following URL:
http://your_application_url/your_project_directory/web

This is how the Symfony Welcome page should look like:
